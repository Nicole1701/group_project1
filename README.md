### Questions of Importance
* Do popular genres change over time?
* Does the audienceâ€™s taste for genre change over time?
* Do seasons have an effect on the metrics of a movie?
* Do seasons impact runtime and audience ratings?
* Has movie revenue (adjusted for inflation) fluctuated through the decades?
* Does duration  have any impact on the financial success of a movie?


### Data Sources
* IMDb movies extensive dataset:

* Box Office Mojo: https://data.world/eliasdabbas/boxofficemojo-alltime-domestic-data


### Other things to take into consideration
* Revenue will need to take into account inflation
* Since movies can belong to more than one genre, we will need to have a separate stacked data set for this comparison

## Popular Genres Over Time

* There is not a lot of variation in the top genre's released over time. Drama  and Comedy have been the top two genres for the last 50 years. There is a little variation in the rest of the top 5, they have included Action, Romance, Crime, Thriller and Adventure (see Genre % Table)

* Dramas make up about 23% of movies released each decade, while comedies make up about 17% of movies released each year.

* But the most popular genres don't necessarily translate into ratings. The highest rated movies of the last 50 years are biography, history and Animation tend to be rated highest (see Ratings Table)

* Looking at the most popular genres over time, their overall ratings tend to be rather consistent, except for the 1970's where movies tended to be rated higher all over.
