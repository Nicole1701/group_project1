### Questions to Answer
* When adjusted for inflation, is there a variation in average revenue over time? 
* Do movies that are rated higher generate more income?
* Does seasonality have any impact on average revenue/ratings?
* Does runtime have any financial impact?
* What percentage of certain genres were released per decade? 
* Do popular genres change over time?

* Box Office Mojo: https://data.world/eliasdabbas/boxofficemojo-alltime-domestic-data


### Other things to take into consideration
* Revenue will need to take into account inflation
* Since movies can belong to more than one genre, we will need to have a separate stacked data set for this comparison
