### Topic: Analysis of Movie Box Office Data in the US

### Possible Questions to Answer
* How many movies of a certain genre were released per year?
* Do popular genres change over time?
* Is there any financial impact based on a movies rating?
* Does runtime have any impact?
* Impact of seasonlity on box office revenue/popularity


### Possible Data Sources
* Movies released by year (look on kaggle)
* Netflix/IMDB data
* Box office financial data (need to find a source for this)


### Other things to take into consideration
* How to account for inflation if not already done in data set 
* How far back in time did we want to go? Did we want to bucket data at all?


## Next Steps
* Find which specific data sets we can use and what kinds of data we can analyze.
